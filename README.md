## üîê Core Features

### Privacy-Preserving Income Verification
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Prove income meets requirements without revealing the amount
- **Attribute-Based Credentials**: Based on Heimdall's credential system
- **Secure Verification**: Cryptographic proofs ensure authenticity

### Selective Proof Verification
- **Dynamic Requirements**: Each listing can specify which proofs are required (income, credit score, or both)
- **Minimum Value Validation**: Proofs are validated against listing-specific minimum requirements
- **Smart UI**: Only shows relevant proof options based on listing requirements
- **Efficient Processing**: Only verifies proofs that are actually required for each listing

### Multi-Party System
- **Renter**: Submit income verification requests
- **Employer**: Issue income credentials
- **Bank**: Verify financial status
- **Landlord**: Verify rental eligibility

### RESTful APIs
- **Employer API**: Income credential issuance
- **Bank API**: Financial verification
- **Landlord API**: Rental application processing

## üîß API Reference

### Employer API (Port 3003)

#### POST /verify-income
Generate a zero-knowledge proof for income verification.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "income": "2500",
  "employerId": "42"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "proof": {
    "type": "attribute",
    "output": {
      "meta": {
        "type": "Income",
        "revoked": false,
        "delegatable": false
      },
      "content": {
        "attribute": "2500",
        "position": 8
      }
    },
    "proof": {
      "pi_a": [...],
      "pi_b": [...],
      "pi_c": [...]
    },
    "publicSignals": [...]
  }
}
```

### Bank API (Port 3002)
Financial verification endpoints for credit checks and account validation.

### Landlord API (Port 3004)
Rental application processing and verification endpoints.

#### POST /listings/:id/apply
Submit a rental application with selective proof validation.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "incomeProof": {
    "type": "attribute",
    "proof": { ... },
    "publicSignals": ["2500"]
  },
  "creditScoreProof": {
    "type": "attribute", 
    "proof": { ... },
    "publicSignals": ["750"]
  }
}
```

**Validation Logic:**
- Only validates proofs that are required by the listing
- Checks minimum value requirements (e.g., income ‚â• ‚Ç¨2000)
- Returns detailed error messages for missing or insufficient proofs

#### POST /listings/:listingId/applications/:applicationId/verify
Verify application proofs based on listing requirements.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "verified": true,
  "details": {
    "incomeVerification": true,
    "creditVerification": true
  }
}
```

**Selective Verification:**
- Only verifies proofs that are required by the listing
- Skips verification of non-required proofs
- Provides detailed breakdown of verification results

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Enhanced Application Workflow

#### Renter Application Process
1. **Browse Listings**: View available properties with their specific proof requirements
2. **Generate Required Proofs**: Only generate proofs that are actually needed for the desired listing
3. **Smart Validation**: System validates that generated proofs meet the listing's minimum requirements
4. **Selective Submission**: Submit application with only the required proofs

#### Landlord Verification Process
1. **Requirement-Based Review**: Only review proofs that are relevant to the listing
2. **Minimum Value Validation**: Verify that submitted proofs meet the specified minimum requirements
3. **Efficient Processing**: Backend only verifies the proofs that are actually required
4. **Clear Feedback**: Detailed status indicators show which proofs are valid, missing, or insufficient

#### Proof Requirements Configuration
Each listing can specify:
- **Income Proof**: Required minimum income (e.g., ‚Ç¨2000/month)
- **Credit Score Proof**: Required minimum credit score (e.g., 700)
- **Both Proofs**: When both income and credit verification are needed
- **No Specific Requirements**: Fallback to requiring both proofs

### Zero-Knowledge Proof System

The system uses **Groth16 zk-SNARKs** with the **Poseidon hash function** for efficient zero-knowledge proofs.

#### Credential Structure
Each credential contains 16 attributes (power of 2 for Merkle tree compatibility):

```
Meta Attributes (8):
[0] ID (e.g., "12345")
[1] Type (e.g., "Income")
[2] Holder public key [0]
[3] Holder public key [1]
[4] Revocation registry URL
[5] Expiration timestamp
[6] Delegatable flag
[7] Empty string

User Attributes (8):
[8]  Income value (e.g., "2500") ‚Üê Target for ZKP
[9]  First name (e.g., "John")
[10] Last name (e.g., "Jones")
[11] Status (e.g., "No Debt")
[12] Status2 (e.g., "Rich")
[13] Empty (padding)
[14] Empty (padding)
[15] Empty (padding)
```

#### System Constraints
- **Maximum credential ID**: 2,064,384 (2^13 √ó 252)
- **Revocation tree size**: 8,192 leaves (2^13)
- **Leaf size**: 252 bits per leaf
- **Merkle tree input**: Must be power of 2

### File Management
All generated files are stored in `servers/employer-api/temp/`:
- `employer_attr_issuer.json` - Input attributes
- `employer_cred_holder.json` - Generated credential
- `employer_holder_pk.json` - Holder public key
- `employer_holder_sk.txt` - Holder secret key
- `employer_issuer_pk.json` - Issuer public key
- `employer_issuer_sk.txt` - Issuer secret key
- `employer_pres_attribute.json` - Generated presentation

## üß™ Testing

### Sample Listings

The system includes three sample listings with different proof requirements:

#### 1. Modern City Apartment (ID: 1)
- **Requirements**: Income ‚â• ‚Ç¨3000 AND Credit Score ‚â• 650
- **Use Case**: High-end apartment requiring both income and credit verification

#### 2. Cozy Suburban House (ID: 2)  
- **Requirements**: Income ‚â• ‚Ç¨4500 AND Credit Score ‚â• 700
- **Use Case**: Premium house with strict financial requirements

#### 3. Income-Only Studio (ID: 3)
- **Requirements**: Income ‚â• ‚Ç¨2000 ONLY
- **Use Case**: Budget-friendly option requiring only income verification

### Manual Testing

1. **Start all services:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test income verification:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/verify-income \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"income": "2500", "employerId": "42"}'
   ```

3. **Test selective application submission:**
   - Access Renter Client: http://localhost:3000
   - Generate income proof with ‚Ç¨2500
   - Try applying to "Income-Only Studio" (should succeed with only income proof)
   - Try applying to "Modern City Apartment" (should require both proofs)

4. **Test landlord verification:**
   - Access Landlord Client: http://localhost:3001
   - View listing details to see proof requirements
   - Review applications and verify only required proofs are processed

5. **Access applications:**
   - Renter Client: http://localhost:3000
   - Landlord Client: http://localhost:3001

### Verify Generated Files
Check the `servers/employer-api/temp/` directory for generated proof files after successful verification.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "No valid in index" Error
**Cause**: Credential ID exceeds revocation tree limits
**Solution**: Ensure credential ID is less than 2,064,384

#### 2. "Length of input must be pow of two" Error
**Cause**: Attribute array doesn't result in power-of-2 total
**Solution**: Pad user attributes to ensure total count is 16 (or other power of 2)

#### 3. "Proof file was not generated" Error
**Cause**: Incorrect file paths in CLI commands
**Solution**: Ensure all files are generated in `/temp` directory

#### 4. Port Conflicts
**Cause**: Services trying to use same port
**Solution**: Check that no other services are running on ports 3000-3004

### Debug Mode
To enable debug logging, add console.log statements:

```javascript
// In heimdalljs-pres-attribute.js
console.log("Credential attributes:", credential.attributes);

// In attribute.js
console.log("Merkle tree input:", cred.attributes);

// In merkleTree.js
console.log("MerkleTree input length:", input.length);
```

### Selective Proof Verification Issues

#### 1. "Cannot verify - missing or insufficient proofs" Error
**Cause**: Application doesn't meet listing's proof requirements
**Solution**: 
- Check listing requirements in landlord dashboard
- Ensure all required proofs are generated
- Verify proof values meet minimum requirements

#### 2. "Income Proof insufficient" Error
**Cause**: Generated income proof doesn't meet listing's minimum income requirement
**Solution**: Generate new income proof with higher value or choose different listing

#### 3. "Missing Income/Credit Score Proof" Error
**Cause**: Required proof type not provided in application
**Solution**: Generate the missing proof type before applying

#### 4. Verification Button Disabled
**Cause**: Application doesn't meet all listing requirements
**Solution**: Check the detailed error messages in the application dialog

### Logs and Monitoring
- Check individual service logs in their respective directories
- Monitor file generation in `servers/employer-api/temp/`
- Verify API responses with curl or Postman
